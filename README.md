Students should use the [Game of Thrones mock API](https://got-mock-api.herokuapp.com/episodes) and use the following endpoints with their React apps:

  - All episodes - https://got-mock-api.herokuapp.com/episodes - to list all the episodes
  - One episode details - https://got-mock-api.herokuapp.com/episodes/{id} - to check the details of a specific episode.
  - Filter by season - have a tab for each of the seasons with all the episodes that belong to that season
  - Search bar - search by episode name.
